<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">I </strong>am a junior level Graphic Design student at San Jos√© State University now. These artworks that I have done in my Digital Media course. The concept of my artworks that relevant to the environment around me as well as myself. My process of creating each artwork was following step by step. When I started to create an artwork, I would ask myself questions such as what kind of the visual effect that I want to deliver and what kind images that I want to use and so on. Then, I started to collect images and took my own photos. Also, there are many related art recourses and technical tutorial in our course website that help me a lot. By using these helpful resources, I created the artworks that I want to express myself.

<p>Most of my projects that I created from Photoshop, Audacity, Premiere, and Atom. Some software that I have never used before such as Audacity, Premiere, and Atom. However, I learned so many skills by creating various projects.  The processing of each project that I follow the course description. For example, when I made a video art project, I first started to record three different sciences, and then put them in the Premiere Pro. Also, I added my own sound that I recorded for my last project. Because there are chirp and water sounds, I decided to create a bird in my video art in order to make a connection. This video art project gives a sense of secret of a bird for viewers because the bird it came out from a picture on a wall because it is curious the outside world. Also, my video art is to express the curiosity because it is one of the important elements of our personalities.
